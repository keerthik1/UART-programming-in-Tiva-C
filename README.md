Sample for UART programming in ARM Cortex-M4F processor Tiva C launchpad (TM4C123GXL). The main objective of this code is to write string/character on to the console, reading the inputs from console and based on input blinking different on board LEDs. This is acheived by programming UART peripheral present in Tiva C launchpad (TM4C123GXL).
